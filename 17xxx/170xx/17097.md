# Problem

There are N ≤ 500,000 people. Some people are "truth tellers" who always tell a truth; the others **may or may not lie.** The i-th person said "there are at least A[i], at most B[i] truth tellers." Find the maximum number of truth tellers.

Then process Q ≤ 500,000 queries. Each query picks one i and changes A[i] and B[i]. After each query, solve the problem again.

# Solution Sketch

There can be exactly x truth tellers if at least x indices i satisfy A[i] ≤ x ≤ B[i].

We initialize an array to 0, -1, -2, ..., -N, and implement these two operations: (1) add 1 or -1 to a subsegment. (2) find the maximum index of a non-negative element. This can be done with a maximum segment tree with lazy propagation, by using a technique similar to finding the k-th smallest element in O(logN) using a segment tree.

# Commentaries

No, O(Nlog^2N) doesn't work in time. At least not for me.
