# Problem

You are given an alphabet string S of length ≤ 500,000 and its N ≤ 100 substrings. Find the shortest substring of S that contains all N substrings.

# Solution Sketch

For the i-th substring, find all possible starting indices with KMP. Then find, for each index j, A[i][j]: the minimum ending index to contain the i-th substring if we start from index j. Then for each j we know the minimum ending index to contain all substrings.
