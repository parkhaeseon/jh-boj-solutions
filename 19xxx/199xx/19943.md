# Problem

You have N ≤ 100,000 points in the Cartesian plane above the x-axis. You can add some equilateral right triangles, whose hypotenuse is a part of the x-axis. Adding a triangle costs money equal to its area. What is the minimum amount of money required so that every point is covered by at least one triangle?

# Solution Sketch

To make things simpler, rotate the whole plane by 45 degrees clockwise, then sort the points by decreasing y-coordinates. Then you get the DP relation:

dp[i] = min_j((y[j] + max{x[j], ..., x[i]})^2 + dp[j-1])

The max thing looks ugly, but note that you can assume that x is in increasing order. The reason is that if x[j] ≤ x[i] and y[j] ≤ y[i], then a triangle covering point i will automatically cover point j, so point j is unnecessary (or you can move point j to the coordinate (x[i], y[j])).

Now we can replace max{} with x[i], which becomes

dp[i] = min_j((y[j] + x[i])^2 + dp[j-1])

which can be optimized with convex hull trick, since this is equal to min_j(2y[j]x[i] + y[j]^2+dp[j-1]) + x[i]^2 and y is decreasing.
