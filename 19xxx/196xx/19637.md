# Problem

You are given a conditional branch with N ≤ 10^5 branches, such that number1 < number2 < ...:

```
if X < number1 then return "name1"
else if X < number2 then return "name2"
else if X < number3 then return "name3"
...
```

For each of the Q ≤ 10^5 numbers, determine what name will be returned.

# Solution Sketch

It can be done by binary searching in the array [number1, number2, ...].
