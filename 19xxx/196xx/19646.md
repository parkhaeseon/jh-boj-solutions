# Problem

You are given an array which is made by writing i w_i times in a row, for i = 1, 2, ..., N â‰¤ 200,000. Apply the following operation N times:

* Find the p_j-th element in the array. Output it, and remove all elements having that value in the array.

# Solution Sketch

Segment tree. Each leaf node contains 0 if the corresponding element i is removed, otherwise w_i. Using this you can find the p_j-th element in O(logN), although O(log^2N) probably might work.
