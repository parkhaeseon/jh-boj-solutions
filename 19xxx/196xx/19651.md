# Problem

You have an array A of length N ≤ 100,000. Process Q ≤ 100,000 queries:

* Add an arithmetic sequence, with the first term x and difference y, to the subarray [i..j].
* Find the longest arithmetic subarray contained in the subarray [i..j]. Output its length. It's guaranteed that i < j.

# Solution Sketch

Let B[0] = 0, and B[i] = A[i] - A[i-1]. Then each query becomes:

* Add x to B[i], and y to B[i+1..j], and -(last term) to B[j+1].
* Find the longest subarray consisting of the same number, contained in the subarray [i+1..j]. Output its length +1.

Now maintain this array as a segment tree with lazy propagation, having (M, L, LM, R, RM), where

* M is the answer in the subarray represented by that node,
* L is the leftmost value,
* LM is the longest subarray length consisting of the same number and containing the leftmost index,
* R and RM are similar but using the right side.

And the lazy value is just a single number to be added to the node.
