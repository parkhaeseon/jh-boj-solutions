# Problem

Given an array of positive integers ≤ 50 of size ≤ 50, partition it into three parts, and consider the sum of each part. Maximize the minimum of the three sums.

# Solution Sketch

Apply knapsack to find all possible (X, Y, Z). To do that, let DP[n][X][Y] = true iff such values of X and Y can be made using the first n elements. You don't need to track Z, because Z = (sum of the first n elements) - X - Y.
