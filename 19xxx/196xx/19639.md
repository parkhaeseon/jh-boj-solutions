# Problem

You have X ≤ 100,000 enemies that damages you by a given amount, and Y ≤ 100,000 healing items that heals you by a given amount. All damages and heals are at most (max HP)/2. Determine whether you can kill all enemies and take all healing items, in some order.

# Solution Sketch

If you only have enemies, or only have heals, then you don't have any option; order will not matter. If you have both, you should keep in mind not to waste any healing items. You can't heal past your max HP.

If your HP is more than (max HP)/2, then kill an enemy. Otherwise, heal. You can take any enemy or item.
