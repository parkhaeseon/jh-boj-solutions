# Problem

A directed graph with 14 vertices is given in the statement. Two vertices A and B are also designated. Find the number of pairs of walks of length n ≤ 10^9, modulo 10^9+7, such that

* One walk starts from A. The other, from B.
* For each i, let X be the i-th vertex of one walk, and Y be the i-th vertex of the other. Then the distance from X to Y, and from Y to X, are both ≥ 3.

# Solution Sketch

Use BFS to find the distances, then let DP[n][a][b] = "number of pairs of walks of length n, such that the walk starting from A ends at a, and the walk from B ends at b". Now since this has a linear recurrence, it can be sped up by representing the relation as a matrix and applying logarithmic time matrix exponentiation.
