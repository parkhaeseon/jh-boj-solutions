# Problem

Interactive problem. You play a game with the judge. You have N stones. If you have a winning strategy, then you must win the judge. Otherwise, you must refuse the game and exit immediately.

The game begins with your turn. In the first turn, you can take only 1 stone. After that, each player can take from 1 to x+1 stones where x is the number of stones the opponent took in the previous turn. The player taking the last stone wins.

# Solution Sketch

Either by game-theory logic or by dynamic programming (with dp[n][k] = whether you can win or not, if you start from n stones and can take k stones in the first turn), you'll eventually reach the following strategy:

* If N is neither 5k+1 nor 5k+4, then you can't win. Otherwise, you can.
* If you can take at most 3 stones such that the number of remaining stones is a multiple of 5, then do it.
* Otherwise, take 1 stone. In that case, the number of remaining stones will be 5k+3 (otherwise you did something wrong).
