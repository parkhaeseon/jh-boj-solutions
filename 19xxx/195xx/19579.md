# Problem

You are given a directed graph with N ≤ 200 vertices and M ≤ 400 edges. Each vertex has a value. You can take some vertices, but for each edge a → b, If you took a, then you must also take b. Maximize the sum of values for the taken vertices.

# Solution Sketch

Instead of values which might be either positive or negative, let's say that each vertex has either

* a penalty for taking that vertex, or
* a penalty for not taking that vertex.

Vertices with positive values correspond to the second case.

Now the problem can be modelled as a minimum cut. Keep the original graph, and assign an infinite cost to each edge. Then, if a vertex has a penalty for taking, connect it to the sink with the cost equal to the penalty. If a vertex has a penalty for not taking, connect the source to it with the cost equal to the penalty.

Find the maximum flow, which equals the minimum cut.
