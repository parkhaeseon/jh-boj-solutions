# Problem

You are given a sequence of N ≤ 5,000 positive integers. Modify minimum number of elements so that, for every pair of elements, one is a multiple of the other.

# Solution Sketch

If you modify something, you should modify it to 1. Therefore that element is basically "removed" from the sequence.

Now sort the sequence, and you need to find the longest subsequence so that each element is a multiple of an element preceding it.

Let DP[n] = "the longest subsequence ending at the n-th element", and you can solve it in O(N^2).
