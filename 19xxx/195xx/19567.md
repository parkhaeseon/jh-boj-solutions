# Problem

In one move, you can choose eiter x-coordinate or y-coordinate and either increment or decrement it by 1. You start from (xs, ys), but you don't know xs and ys. Instead, you are given N ≤ 100,000 tuples (x, y, d), meaning you can reach (x, y) in exactly d moves. Find (xs, ys) with minimum xs (and then minimum ys), or report that no such (xs, ys) exists.

# Solution Sketch

Just like [19563](/19xxx/195xx/19563.md) you first loop over all the tuples and check the parity. If all the parities match, then loop over the tuples again and maintain the set of all possible (xs, ys). They will form a rectangle rotated 45 degrees. To make implementation easier, you can try rotating the entire coordinate 45 degrees, i.e. transform (x, y) to (x+y, x-y).
