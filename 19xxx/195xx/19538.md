# Problem

You have a graph with N ≤ 200,000 vertices. Some of them are activated, and each of the other vertex is activated only after it gets energy from at least half of its adjacent vertices. Once a vertex is activated, it takes 1 minute to send energy to all adjacent vertices at once. Find the time for each vertex to be activated.

# Solution Sketch

Just like a BFS with multiple sources, but insert a vertex v into the queue only after it's activated.
