# Problem

You are given a tree with ≤ 100,000 vertices. You start from a given vertex v. Whenever you stand on a vertex, every vertex ≤ D edges away is activated. Find the minimum time to activate all vertices and go back to v.

# Solution Sketch

Root at v, and you need to precisely visit all vertices that contains in its subtree a vertex with distance > D. Find the number of such vertices, k, and the answer is 2k-2.
