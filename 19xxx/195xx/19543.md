# Problem

A dungeon is a grid of N ≤ 200,000 rows and M ≤ 200,000 columns. Each cell contains 'R' or 'U', meaning you should go right or up after clearing that cell. A dungeon can be "cleared" if you eventually reach (N,M).

The dungeon was generated in the following way: first generate K ≤ 26 different rows of 'R' and 'U', and pick one of the rows N times in some order. The K different rows and the order is given.

Find the number of starting cells from which you can reach (N,M).

# Solution Sketch

Start from the top row and go downwards. Then the set of the feasible starting cells will form an interval, whose starting and endpoints are at most those of the interval above it. Therefore it can be found with two pointers.

Specifically, for each row, decrement the endpoint until you reach 'U' or surpass the starting point. In the latter case, there are no more valid cells. In the former case, decrement the starting point right before reaching 'U'. This gives the interval for the current row.
