# Problem

You have a tree with N ≤ 300,000 vertices. Let D be the number of subgraphs isomorphic to the chain of 4 vertices, and G be the number of subgraphs isomorphic to the star graph with 4 vertices. Compare D and 3G.

# Solution Sketch

To compute D, fix the middle edge, and for each edge with end-vertices a and b, add (deg(a)-1)*(deg(b)-1).

To compute G, fix the middle vertex, and for each vertex v, add v(v-1)(v-2)/6.
