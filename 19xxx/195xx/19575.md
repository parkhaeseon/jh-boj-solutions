# Problem

Using Horner's rule (explained in the original statement), evaluate the polynomial of degree N ≤ 10^6 at the value x. Output it modulo 10^9+7.

# Solution Sketch

Since Horner's rule is explained in the original problem statement, you can exactly do what it says. However, you should be careful with overflows. Even if you use languages like Python which doesn't have overflows, dealing with huge numbers will lead to TLE. Always divide by 10^9+7 every time you multiply or add.
