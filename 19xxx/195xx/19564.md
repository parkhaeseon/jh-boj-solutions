# Problem

Given a string S of lowercase alphabets of length ≤ 10^5, find the minimum k such that "abcd...xyz" repeated k times contains S as a subsequence.

# Solution Sketch

Whenever S[i] precedes or equals S[i-1] (i.e. the Ascii code is smaller or equal), you need to increment k. Therefore the answer is (the number of i such that S[i] ≤ S[i-1]) + 1, because you also need to increment k for the very first letter.
