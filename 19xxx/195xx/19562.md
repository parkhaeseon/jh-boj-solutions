# Problem

Given an N*N matrix where N ≤ 500, compute det(A-xI) mod 998,244,353 at Q ≤ 250,000 different values of x.

# Solution Sketch

det(A-xI), known as the characteristic polynomial, is a polynomial on x with degree ≤ N+1, so if we can find the polynomial then the rest is trivial. So how do we find it? One way is to compute det(A-xI) at N+1 different values of x and applying Lagrange interpolation. The second part takes O(N^3) naively, but the first part takes O(N^4).

To speed it up, we change the matrix while preserving the characteristic polynomial (that is, similar transformation), so that Gaussian elimination takes only O(N^2). We can do that using Hessenberg decomposition, which can be implemented using Gaussian elimination in O(N^3).
