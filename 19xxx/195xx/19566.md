# Problem

Given a sequence A of length ≤ 200,000, find the number of subarrays with average K.

# Solution Sketch

When the average is fixed, it's often useful to subtract K from each element. So we do exactly that, and find the number of subarrays with average 0. But average 0 is equivalent to sum 0.

Now let S[0] = 0, and S[i] = S[i-1] + A[i]. A subarray sum of A[i..j] is then represented by S[j] - S[i-1]. Therefore we need to count the number of (i, j) such that i ≤ j and S[j] = S[i-1]. Store all the S[i] values in something like a std::map, and for each x in the map, let M be the number of occurrences of x, then add x(x-1)/2.
