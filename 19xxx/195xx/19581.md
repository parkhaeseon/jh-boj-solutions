# Problem

Find the second-largest distance between two vertices in a tree with N ≤ 100,000 vertices.

# Solution Sketch

Let A and B be the farthest two vertices in a tree (which is the diameter). A and B are leaves.

If we look for the second-farthest two vertices, then at least one of them will not equal A or B. Remove A from the tree and find the diameter. Add A back, remove B, and find the diameter again. The larger of the two values is the answer.
