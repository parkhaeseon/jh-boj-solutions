# Problem

You can buy A roses for B euro, or C roses for D euro, where A, B, C, D ≤ 10^5. Buy at least N ≤ 10^15 roses in minimum cost possible.

# Solution Sketch

Either "A roses option" or "C roses option" need to be taken at most 10^5 times. This is because taking the first option C times and the second option A times give the same amount of roses, so it's better to choose whichever is cheaper.

If we fix the number of times one particular option is taken, we know the number of times the other option is taken in O(1). Now we just need brute-force.
