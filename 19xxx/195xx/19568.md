# Problem

Find any 30*30 rectangular grid of integers from 0 to 10^6 such that:

* Let S be the set of all subrectangle sums. Then S contains all of 1, 2, ..., 50000.

# Solution Sketch

Three years ago there was [15311](/15xxx/153xx/15311.md) which is basically the one-dimensional version of this problem. Let's extend it to two dimensions.

To do that, you have to place 14 A's, 14 B's, 14 C's, and 14 D's, such that you can freely choose how many A, B, C, and D you want to include in a subrectangle. Then fill the rest of the grid with 0. My solution looks like this:

```
0 0 0 0 A 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 A 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 A 0 0 0
B B B 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 C C C
0 0 0 D 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 D 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 D 0 0 0 0
```
