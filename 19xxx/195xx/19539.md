# Problem

You have an integer array A of length ≤ 100,000, initialized with zeroes. You have to repeat the following operation:

* pick two indices i and j (can be equal). Increment A[i] twice, and A[j] once.

You are given a non-negative integer array B of the same length. Determine if you can turn A into B.

# Solution Sketch

The sum of elements of B must be a multiple of 3. Let S be the sum divided by 3, which is the number of operations.

S must be of the form T+2k, where T is the sum of x%2 for x in B, and k is some non-negative integer. Thus, S ≥ T and (S-T)%2 == 0 must hold.

If all is good, then the answer is yes.
