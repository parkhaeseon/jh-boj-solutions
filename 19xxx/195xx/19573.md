# Problem

You have a beehive of radius N ≤ 6. Each cell contains an integer. You are also given F.

You can pick some cells. If you pick a cell, you can either spend F energy, or gain the energy written in the cell. Find the maximum total energy such that the picked cells are connected.

# Solution Sketch

For every cell with energy < -F, change its energy to -F. Also shift each row of the hexagonal grid so that the beehive can be represented in the square grid:

```
a b c . .
d e f g .
h i j k l
. m n o p
. . q r s
```

Then it becomes a typical DP with connection profile.
