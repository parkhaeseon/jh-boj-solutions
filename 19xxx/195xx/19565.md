# Problem

Given N ≤ 1,000, find the longest sequence of integers from 1 to N such that

* the first and last element is 1, and
* for all i and j, either A[i] != A[j] or A[i+1] != A[j+1] (or both).

# Solution Sketch

The second condition is equivalent to !(A[i] == A[j] and A[i+1] == A[j+1]), which basically means that there are no duplicate subarrays of length 2.

Now consider a directed graph of N vertices, and draw an edge from every vertex to every vertex. Construct a sequence by moving around in this graph, starting from 1 and ending at 1, but you can't take the same edge twice.

You can prove that it's possible to take every edge exactly once, that is, make an Eulerian circuit. Proof is by induction on N: ignore the vertex N, recursively make an Eulerian circuit, then take 1 → N → 2 → N → ... → N-1 → N → N → 1.
