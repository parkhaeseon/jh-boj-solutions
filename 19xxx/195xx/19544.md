# Problem

Consider a function f: {1, ..., N} -> {1, ..., N}, where N ≤ 500. Define a directed graph G on N vertices, with the edges (i, f(i)) for each i. Define a N*N matrix M, where M[i][j] is 1 if j is reachable from i, otherwise 0.

You are given M. Given that at least one f exists for this M, find the number of possible f, modulo 10^9+7.

# Solution Sketch

G looks like some kind of directed "forest", consisting of "root" cycles and the other edges directed towards one of them.

How do we find the root cycles? Consider the sum for each row of M. Then v is a part of the root cycle iff from v there isn't any reachable vertex with the smaller row sum. That's the fastest way (since the input is O(N^2) already), and less efficient solutions are acceptable.

For each root cycle, there are (K-1)! possible ways to define f(v) inside that cycle, where K is the size of the cycle.

For each v such that v is not in the root cycle but f(v) is, there are K possible ways to define f(v), where K is the size of the cycle.
