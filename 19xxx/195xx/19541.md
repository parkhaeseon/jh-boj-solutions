# Problem

You have a boolean array of length ≤ 100,000. You repeat the following operation ≤ 100,000 times:

* pick a subset of indices. If any index has a value True, then change all indices to value True.

The sum of subset sizes is ≤ 1,000,000.

You are given the array after all operations. Recover the very first array (if there are multiple ways to do this, output any), or report impossible.

# Solution Sketch

Process the operations backwards. If any index has a value False, then change all indices to value False, because otherwise that index wouldn't have been False.

After the backward processing, forward process again, and if we get the correct result, output the backward-processed array. Otherwise, impossible.
