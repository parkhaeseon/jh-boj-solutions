# Problem

There is a circular cake centered at the origin, with radius R. Peppermint is located on (x, y). N mice ate the cake. Each mouse ate a circular portion of the cake. These circles are contained entirely within the cake and do not intersect with each other.

Find the angle to cut the cake in a straight line such that peppermint is placed on the line and the area of the cake is exactly halved.

# Solution Sketch

Let f(t) be the area of the right side of the cake if the line has angle t. Computing f(t) is some heavy geometry. For each circle, find the distance from the center to the line, and use it to compute the area intersecting with the right side of the line. The intersecting region can be divided into a triangle and a sector.

Now let g(t) = f(t) - (area of the cake)/2. Then g(0) and g(pi) have different signs, and g is continuous, so by intermediate value theorem there is a solution of g(t) = 0 between 0 and pi.

To find the t, apply bisection method, which is something similar to binary search. Determine either to take l = mid or to take r = mid, so that g(l) and g(r) always have different signs.
