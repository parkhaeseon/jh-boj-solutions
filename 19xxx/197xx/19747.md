# Problem

You have a permutation P of size N â‰¤ 200,000. A permutation Q of size N is initialized as [1, ..., N]. In one operation, you can take the last element of Q and put it to first. How many operations are required so that no index i satisfies P[i] = Q[i]? Or is it impossible?

# Solution Sketch

If the answer exists, it must be <n. For each i, there is exactly one value of k such that, if the operation is applied k times then P[i] = Q[i] holds. Compute that number and erase it for all i, and if there is still a number remaining, output the minimum.
