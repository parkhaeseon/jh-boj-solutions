# Problem

You have a weighted graph with V ≤ 100,000 vertices and E ≤ 100,000 edges. Each edge has a "bonus value." For each v = 2, ..., V, answer the following question:

You start walking at vertex 1 and end at v. Along the way, you must choose exactly one edge and take its bonus value. Minimize (weight of the walk) - (bonus value).

# Solution Sketch

Let's consider the walk taken before taking the bonus value, and the walk taken after taking the bonus value. Then each of the two walks should be a shortest path.

First, use Dijkstra to find the shortest path from 1 to all vertices (including 1), without taking the bonus. The shortest path to 1 is obviously 0.

Next, find the minimum (weight of the walk) - (bonus value) from 1 to all vertices such that the last edge's bonus value is taken, using the distance values obtained before. Denote that value for v as D[v].

Finally, make a new vertex, connect it to all vertices using an edge with weight D[v]. Run Dijkstra from the new vertex. Although D[v] can be negative, it can be proven that Dijkstra actually works well in this graph. To see why, add X to all D[v] to make them non-negative, think about running Dijkstra, then subtract X from the distance values.
