# Problem

Given S = {1, ..., N} where N ≤ 100,000, a collection of subsets of S (sum of sizes ≤ 500,000), and M ≤ 200,000 pairs, pick a subset T of S such that

* for each subset U in the given collection, |T \cap U| ≤ 1.
* for each given pair, at least one element is contained in T.

# Solution Sketch

There is an easy-to-construct O(|S|^2+M) 2-SAT modeling, but that's too large. Fortunately, there is a way to construct the first condition in O(|S|).

For a subset U = {x1, ..., xk}, introduce k more variables: B1, ..., Bk. We want to make Bi <=> (x1 or ... or xi is chosen). For each i, add:

* Bi => B(i+1)
* Ai => Bi
* Bi => ~A(i+1)

Of course, P => Q is equivalent to (~P or Q).
