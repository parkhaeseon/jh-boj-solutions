# Problem

You have an N*M grid, where N, M ≤ 100. Visit each cell exactly once so that, for every 3 consecutive cells, they are in a strictly counter-clockwise position. Or report that it's impossible.

# Solution Sketch

If N = 1 or M = 1, then the other value must be ≤ 2. Otherwise, always possible. My solution is not very simple, but basically I handled two rows at once, except the last three rows if N is odd.
