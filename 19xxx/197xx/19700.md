# Problem

You have N ≤ 500,000 people with distinct heights. Each person has a value k. Partition them into minimum number of sets, such that for every person, there are ≤ k people taller than them in their set.

# Solution Sketch

Sort by height, and determine, for each person from tallest to shortest, which set this person should belong to. This person cannot go into a set with size ≥ k.

It turns out, you can just choose the largest set with size < k, or make a new set if no such set exists. To prove it, use induction to show that "the number of sets is minimized, and the size of the smallest set is minimized."

To implement it, use binary search to find the desired set.
