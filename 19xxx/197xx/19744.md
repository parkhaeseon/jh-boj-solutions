# Problem

N â‰¤ 100,000 soldiers are standing in a line, each having their height, and looking either to the left or right. Soldier i can see soldier j if i is looking towards j and no soldiers between them are taller than soldier j. For each i, count how many soldiers soldier i can see.

# Solution Sketch

If all soldiers are facing left, then it's a typical stack problem. Scanning from left to right, maintain the list of soldiers that the current soldier can see, then it will be in the decreasing order of height, so you can use stack to maintain it.

In general case, first scan from left to right, then scan from right to left.
