# Problem

Given N â‰¤ 10^18, find the smallest integer larger than N such that no two adjacent digits are equal.

# Solution Sketch

Start by adding 1 to N.

Find the leftmost position that contains two adjacent digits. N will always have two adjacent equal digits until this position is changed, so add 10^k to change this position. And then you can just fill the rest with 010101... or 101010...
