# Problem

You have a graph with N ≤ 3,000 vertices. You have to partition a sequence 1, 2, ..., N into one or more subarrays. Your score is the number of pairs of vertices (a, b) such that exactly one of the following holds:

* a and b are in the same subarray.
* a and b are adjacent (in the graph).

Minimize the score.

# Solution Sketch

Let dp[n] = "minimum score for the first n vertices". Then, dp[n] is a minimum, over all k ≤ n, of the value (dp[k-1] + A(k, n) + B(k, n)), where

* A(k, n) is the number of non-adjacent pairs in the interval [k, n]
* B(k, n) is the number of adjacent pairs, one in [1, k-1] and the other in [k, n].

If we know all the values of A and B, then the rest is O(N^2). Now notice that A and B can be expressed using the submatrix sums of the adjacency matrix of the graph. With an O(N^2) precomputation you can compute the submatrix sum in O(1).
