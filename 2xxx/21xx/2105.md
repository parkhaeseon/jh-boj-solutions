# Problem

Monkey 1 is hanging from the ceiling. Including it, N ≤ 200,000 monkeys are holding each other; each hand holding or not holding one monkey. Any monkey losing connection from monkey 1 will fall down.

Every second, someone's hand is released. Determine precisely when each monkey falls down.

# Solution Sketch

When monkey A holds B, an edge between them is made. (It should be undirected!) Label each edge with the time when it is removed, or INF if it's never removed. Then the answer for monkey x is the minimum bottleneck path from monkey 1 to x, which can be found with modified Dijkstra's algorithm.
