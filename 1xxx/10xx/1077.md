# Problem

Find the area of the intersection of two convex polygons, with ≤ 100 vertices each.

# Solution Sketch

The intersection of two convex shapes is again convex, and in this problem, a convex polygon.

If two edges from different polygons intersect, the intersection point is a part of the border of the intersecting region. If a vertex of a polygon is inside the other polygon, it is also a part of the border of the intersecting region. These precisely determines the intersecting region, whose area can be computed by ordering the vertices correctly and using the shoelace formula.
