# Problem

Given two circles, output the number of intersections (or -1 if there are infinitely many intersections).

# Solution Sketch

Let D be the **squared** distance between the centers of the two triangles, (x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2. Let R = r1+r2.

* If D = 0, then the answer is 0 if r1 != r2, otherwise -1.
* If R^2 = D or (r1-r2)^2 = D, then the two circles are tangent to each other. The answer is 1.
* If R^2 < D or (r1-r2)^2 > D, then the two circles are disjoint. The answer is 0.
* Otherwise, the answer is 2.

# Commentaries

The reason I used the squared distance is that the distance will be stored in a floating number, and it's very dangerous to compare one floating number with another for equality. I think it might be fine for this problem since we are comparing with an integer (R or abs(r1-r2)), but it's still too dangerous.
