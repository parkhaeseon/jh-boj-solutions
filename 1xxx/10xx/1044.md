# Problem

You are given two arrays of equal even length N ≤ 36, A and B. Partition {1, ..., N} into two sets of equal size, X and Y, such that the difference between (the sum of A[i] for all i in X) and (the sum of B[i] for all i in Y) is minimized. Output the lexicographically first such partition.

# Solution Sketch

Basically meet-in-the-middle. If exactly k elements in X are ≤ N/2 (left half), then N/2-k elements in X will be in the right half. Fix one value of k, generate all k-subsets of the left half and (N/2-k)-subsets of the right half, combine just like a usual meet-in-the-middle algorithm, repeat over all possible values of k. 2^(N/2) subsets will be generated in total from each half, so it works in time.

# Commentaries

If you are using two pointers for the combining step, you may want to remove duplicate values with different sets and leave only the lexicographically first set. (That's why I got a wrong answer!)
