# Problem

Let N ≤ 1,000. An integer can be partitioned into substrings such that each substring forms an arithmetic sequence. Let D(n) be the miniumm number of substrings required for n. Find the number of N-digit integers n such that

* the digits form a non-decreasing sequence, and
* D(n) = A.

Output it modulo 10^9+7.

# Solution Sketch

D(n) can be computed using a greedy approach: from the leftmost digit find the longest substring that forms an arithmetic sequence, repeat. Every substring except the last must have langth ≥ 2.

We can see that D(n) ≤ 9, so if A > 9, then the answer is 0. Now assume A ≤ 9.

Let dp[i][a][j][d] be the number of non-decreasing i-digit integers, with D(n) = a, such that the last digit is j, the last substring has the common difference d, and **the last substring has length ≥ 2.** Case analysis based on the last substring:

* length 2, and i ≥ 2. The last substring is j-d and j. Add the sum of dp[i-2][a-1][nj][nd] such that nj + nd != j-d.
* length ≥ 3, and i ≥ length. Add dp[i-1][a][j-d][d].

Add the values of the form dp[N][A][...][...].

Finally, to take care of the numbers whose last substring has length 1, you just need to add the values of the form dp[N-1][A-1][...][...].

You might need to take N = 1 as a special case.
