# Problem

Output the number of times 0 and 1 are printed, respectively, when fibonacci(N) is called. 0 is printed whenever fibonacci(0) is called. 1 is printed whenever fibonacci(1) is called.

# Solution Sketch

DP. Let Z[i] be the number of 0's printed, and O[i] be the number of 1's printed, then we get Z[i+2] = Z[i] + Z[i+1] and O[i+2] = O[i] + O[i+1].

# Commentaries

This demonstrates why memoization is necessary to compute Fibonacci numbers in this way.
