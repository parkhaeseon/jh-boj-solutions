# Problem

Given A and B ≤ 10^18, find the number of non-negative integers A ≤ x ≤ B such that:

* Flip x horizontally. The digits 0, 1, and 8 flips to itself, 2 and 5 flip to each other, and all other digits flip to gibberish. When x is flipped horizontally, you get the same number x.

For example, 1521 satisfies this condition.

# Solution Sketch

Note that there are only 5 kinds of digits allowed, and you just need to consider the right half of x and mirror it to get the left half. These observations are enough to bring the number of candidates down to 2*5^9 = 3906250.
