# Problem

You have an array A and B of length ≤ 500,000. You start with 0 coins and 0 score. For each i in order, you must do exactly one of the following:

* Subtract A[i] from the current score and abandon all coins.
* Add A[i] to the current score and get one coin. Then, if you have M coins, add B[i] to the current score and abandon all coins.

Find the maximum score.

# Solution Sketch

Let DP[i][j] = "maximum score, after i operations, ending with j coins", then

* DP[i][0] = max(max(DP[i-1][k] for all k)-A[i], DP[i-1][M-1]+A[i]+B[i]))
* DP[i][j] = DP[i-1][j-1] + A[i]

Now consider the DP table, and push each row to the right to form a staircase, then the DP computation reduces to adding values to subsegments and finding subsegment maximums. Apply segment tree with lazy propagation.

# Commentaries

In fact, my solution is overkill. With some observation you can deduce that you need only two states: either you have 0 coins, or at least 1 coin. This gives an easier, faster DP.
