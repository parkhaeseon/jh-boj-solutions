# Problem

Find the number of N-digit numbers such that

* all adjacent digits differ by exactly 1, and
* all digits appear at least once,

modulo 10^9.

# Solution Sketch

DP, where each DP state is represented by (n, l, r, d) where

* n is the number of digits so far,
* l is the smallest digit,
* r is the largest digit,
* d is the last digit.

The answer is the sum of DP(N, 0, 9, d) over all d.

# Commentaries

For some reason most problem solvers in Korea seem to think that this is a bitmask DP O(N2^B) problem (where B is the base; B=10 in this problem), but I think it's much easier to come up with an O(NB^2) solution.
