# Problem

You have a mixture of tea and milk. Initially tea and milk was mixed half and half. You apply the following operations N â‰¤ 100,000 times: drink half of the liquid, then add either half tea or half milk.

Which did you drink more: tea or milk?

# Solution Sketch

We keep track of the amount of tea and milk remaining. Initially both have the amount of 0.5. Each operation is dividing each by 2, and adding 0.5 to either tea or milk. Floating points obviously won't work, and exact arithmetic will take O(N^2) time, because you are dividing and adding an O(N)-digit number O(N) times.

However, the operation becomes easier if you use binary, because you just need to move a radix point (the "." in "0.01") and add 0.1, which doesn't require any carries. Thus it takes O(N) in total. It turns out that you don't even need to divide or add anything; you can get the final remaining amount in binary directly from the sequence of operations.

Finally, you get the amount you drink by subtracting the amount you poured into the cup (including the initial amount) and the amount remaining.

# Commentaries

The above observation shows that you don't even need to use binary! Since the "amount remaining" is so small relative to "amount you poured", the whole problem can be solved with some case analysis.
