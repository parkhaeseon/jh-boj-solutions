# Problem

You have an array of length 2N â‰¤ 10,000. Match up the elements in N pairs, then consider the sum of the elements in each pair. Then your score is the minimum of these N sums. Maximize your score.

# Solution Sketch

To maximize the score, you have to sort the array, then match the smallest to the largest, 2nd smallest to 2nd largest, ...

Why? Suppose you want to answer "can the answer be at least X?" This is equivalent to "can we match up the elements so that every pair has the sum at least X?" Then the largest element has the most options to choose, and the smallest element has the least options to choose. As you go from the largest from the smallest, the available options gradually disappear. Therefore the largest value should match with the option that would disappear first.
