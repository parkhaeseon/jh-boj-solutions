# Problem

You have an array of length N â‰¤ 250,000. Find the first K largest contiguous subarray sums.

# Solution Sketch

Consider the prefix sum S_i. The largest contiguous subarray sum is the maximum of S_i - S_j for all i > j, so for each i, find the smallest S_j for i > j. Once you find the largest S_i - S_j, you have to find the next smallest S_j for that value of i.

You need a data structure that can answer this query online: "find the k-th smallest element among the first n elements." This is exactly what persistent segment tree does. After that, finding the maximum of S_i - S_j and replacing it with another number can be done with a priority queue.
