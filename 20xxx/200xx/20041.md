# Problem

N ≤ 500,000 police and one thief are placed on the infinitely large grid. In each turn, the following happens in order:

* The thief moves to one of the neighboring cells.
* Each of the police may or may not move to one of the neighboring cells.
* If one of the police is placed in the same place as the thief, police wins.

The thief wins if it's possible to not get caught forever. Who has the winning strategy?

# Solution Sketch

It can be shown that the best strategy for the thief is to move in one direction, so there are only 4 strategies to consider.

Now think of the Cartesian coordinate, where the thief is placed at the origin, and suppose the thief moves up. Then thief wins iff there is no police at y ≥ |x|.
