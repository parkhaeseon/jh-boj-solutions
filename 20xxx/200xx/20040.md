# Problem

You are given a graph G with N ≤ 500,000 vertices but no edges. You'll add the edges one by one. The order of the edges to be added is given. Find the first edge such that, when added, G has a cycle.

# Solution Sketch

When adding an edge (a, b), check if a and b are already connected. If so, addition of (a, b) creates a cycle. This can be checked by disjoint set.
