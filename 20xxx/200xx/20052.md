# Problem

You are given a string S of length ≤ 100,000, consisting of '(' and ')'. Process ≤ 100,000 queries:

* Given l ≤ r, determine whether S[l..r] is a valid parenthesis string.

# Solution Sketch

Convert '(' to +1, and ')' to -1, then consider the prefix sum array P. Then S[l..r] is valid iff

* P[l-1] = P[r], and
* min(P[l], ..., P[r]) ≥ P[r].

The first condition is easy, and the second condition is a segment tree exercise.
