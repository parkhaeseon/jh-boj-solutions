# Problem

Let's consider hashing a string s as the sum of p^i*s[i], modulo 10^9+7. where s[i] means the ASCII code of the i-th letter of s. Find two strings A and B, both consisting of lowercase alphabets and having the same lengths ≤ 300,000, and having the same hash value whenever p is one of 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67.

# Solution Sketch

The given hash is a polynomial on p. Let f = (hash polynomial of A) - (hash polynomial of B), then each coefficient is from -25 to 25, and f(29) = f(31) = ... = f(67) = 0 (modulo 10^9+7). Now how do we find a polynomial f that satisfies these conditions?

A usual idea is f(x) = (x-29)(x-31)...(x-67), but that violates the coefficient condition. You have to keep the coefficients of each factor as small as possible. So instead of (x-p), find some (±x^a±x^b±1), or (±x^a±x^b±x^c±1), that evaluates to 0 at x = p.
