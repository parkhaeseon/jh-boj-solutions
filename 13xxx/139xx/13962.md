# Problem

You have a rooted tree with N â‰¤ 100,000 vertices. Each vertex has a "rank" r[v] and "time" t[v]. For each vertex v, find the sum of all t[u] over u in the subtree rooted at v such that r[u] < r[v].

# Solution Sketch

Sort the vertices by r, then you can solve the problem by doing the following queries on the tree: (1) add t[v] to v. (2) find the sum of all t[u] over u in the subtree rooted at v. (don't think about r, since we sorted by r already.) This is a simple Euler tour trick exercise combined with segment trees.
