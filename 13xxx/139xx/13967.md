# Problem

Given a graph with K â‰¤ 50,000 edges, whose vertices are points in the 3D Cartesian space, find whether it has a cycle, and then find whether its projection to the xy-plane has a cycle (where duplicate vertices and edges due to the projection are counted only once).

# Solution Sketch

This is a basic cycle detection problem, with a little bit of implementation. Make sure to remove duplicate vertices and edges, as well as self-loops, when doing a projection.
