# Problem

You are D â‰¤ 20 years older than your brother. Every year since you were 4 years old, you put X candles in your box, where X is your age at that time. Every year since your brother was 3 years old, he did the same.

Your box has R < 1000 candles, and your brother's box has T < 1000 candles. But in fact, your brother put some of his candles into your box. How many?

# Solution Sketch

The total number of candles is (4 + ... + (A+D)) + (3 + ... + A) for some A. Find such A by brute-forcing. Then you know how many candles are supposed to be in your box. Subtract R from that number.
