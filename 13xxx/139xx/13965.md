# Problem

You have a weighted graph with ≤ 200 vertices and ≤ 200 edges, whose edge weights are integers from 1 to 13. You don't know their weights, but you have ≤ 500 walks on the graph and you know the total weight of each walk modulo 13. It's guaranteed that the edge weights can be recovered from these uniquely. Find the shortest path from one given vertex to another.

# Solution Sketch

What you really have is a system of T linear equations (modulo 13) on E variables, where T is the number of walks and E is the number of edges. Since 13 is prime, you can apply Gaussian elimination to recover the edge weights. Then apply Dijkstra to find the shortest path.

# Commentaries

Some people were confused about what sentence in the description indicates that the edge weights can be recovered uniquely. It's this sentence that indicates the guarantee: "Alice, no matter where you are, or where you want to go, or the track you choose, you'll be able to find how long it takes you."
