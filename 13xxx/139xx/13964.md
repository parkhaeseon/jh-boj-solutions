[13964. Pascal's Hyper-Pyramids](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/13964)

Source: SWERC 2016


# Problem

Find all distinct numbers on the H-th floor of the D-dimensional Pascal hyper-pyramid. D, H < 32 and all numbers are < 2^63.

# Solution Sketch

A number on the H-th floor can be described by (H-1)!/(a1)!(a2)!...(aD)!, where each ai is a non-negative integer whose sum is H-1. So we need to find those tuples (a1, ..., aD) such that a1 ≤ ... ≤ aD. Since the number of such tuples is quite small, you can actually find them all with backtracking.

# Commentaries

The largest number for D=H=31 is 265252859812191058636308480000000, so you really need the 2^63 constraint.
