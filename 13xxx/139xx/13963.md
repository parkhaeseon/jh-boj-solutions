[13963. Cairo Corridor](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/13963)

Source: SWERC 2016


# Problem

You have a Cairo pentagonal tiling with ≤ 250 rows and ≤ 250 columns. Each tile is white or black. A connected component of white tiles is called a "corridor" if it touches all four borders. A corridor is called "minimal" if removal of any tile makes it not a connected corridor. Find the minimal corridor if any.

# Solution Sketch

Finding which tiles are adjacent is just a case-by-case implementation. This is what I did:

```
if(j%2==1 && (i+j/2)%2==0){
    // vertical b
    Q = {{i-1,j}, {i,j-1}, {i,j+1}, {i,j+2}, {i+1,j-1}};
}
else if(j%2==1 && (i+j/2)%2==1){
    // horizontal b
    Q = {{i,j-2}, {i,j-1}, {i,j+1}, {i+1,j-1}, {i+1,j}};
}
else if(j%2==0 && (i+j/2)%2==0){
    // vertical a
    Q = {{i-1,j+1}, {i,j-2}, {i,j-1}, {i,j+1}, {i+1,j}};
}
else{
    // horizontal a
    Q = {{i-1,j}, {i-1,j+1}, {i,j-1}, {i,j+2}, {i,j+1}};
}
```

After that, finding a corridor is a graph traversal exercise. As the problem description says, there can be at most one corridor.

Determining whether the corridor is minimal is not trivial. There would be a simpler approach than mine, but I tested whether each vertex is an articulation point. If a vertex is not an articulation point, then it must be a unique vertex incident with one particular border; otherwise you can just remove that vertex, so the corridor is not minimal.
