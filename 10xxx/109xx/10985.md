# Problem

Find the shortest curve from point A to point B on the Cartesian plane that does not intersect with the interior of the circle with radius r centered at the origin.

# Solution Sketch

First check if the line segment from A to B does not intersect with the circle. If so, the answer is the Euclidean distance from A to B. This can be done by computing the distance between the line segment to the origin and comparing with r.

If it intersects, the optimal curve consists of a tangent from A to the circle, some arc along the circle, then a tangent from the circle to B. This gives at most 8 candidates: two for the first tangent, two for the arc, and two for the second tangent.
