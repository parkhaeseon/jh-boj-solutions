# Problem

You have N ≤ 14 convex polygons with ≤ 10,000 vertices each and equal height, which you can't rotate. You want to push them into a rectangular tunnel with the same height as the polygons. Find the minimum width of the tunnel to contain all polygons.

# Solution Sketch

For each i and j, we compute how much width can be saved by pushing polygon j right after i. This can be computed by finding, for each y, how much width can be saved when the two polygon intersects at y, and computing the minimum of them. This can be simplified by noting that the minimum will happen at one of the y-values of the vertices of both polygons.

After that, we solve TSP with bitmask DP.

# Commentaries

This has very few solves in the contest and in Codeforces, but I don't think it is that difficult. It's a weird geometry problem that can scare people off, though.
