# Problem

Given an alphabet string of length ≤ 10^5, find the number of distinct values of S(t) for all substrings t of s, where S is defined by: interpreting a=1, b=2, ..., z=26, the sum of all characters in t.

# Solution Sketch

Consider the prefix sum P, and we want to find the number of different positive values of P[i]-P[j].

If we were looking for P[i]+P[j], we would have just used FFT to find the square of the polynomial. Instead, we use FFT to multiply the polynomial and its reversal.

For example, if P = {1,3,6}, then since we should multiply (1+x+x^3+x^6) with (1+x^-1+x^-3+x^-6), we first multiply the second polynomial by x^6, use FFT, then divide by x^6.
