# Problem

You have an array of length N ≤ 100,000, each element being an integer from 1 to 100,000. Initially all elements are 1. Process Q ≤ 100,000 queries **online**:

* Count the number of elements with value exactly P. From this number you are given an instruction about how to generate an interval. Change all numbers within that interval to X.

After all queries, let X be a most frequent element. Output the number of times X appears.

# Solution Sketch

Represent the array as a sequence of (i, X, n), meaning that X appears n times in a row starting from index i. For example, [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1] would be (0, 1, 2), (2, 2, 1), (3, 1, 3).

Maintain this sequence as an std::set and an array that counts the number of each element. A tuple (i, X, n) can be deleted only after being inserted, and there will be O(N+Q) tuples inserted, so it works in time.

For easy implementation, implement a subroutine that given (i, X, n) and a range, removes only a portion of (i, X, n) that intersects with the range.
