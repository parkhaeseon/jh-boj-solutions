# Problem

You have a sequence of N ≤ 100,000 integers. A sequence is "good" if it can be divided into subsegments such that, for each subsegment, the first number is equal to its length.

Each element has a weight W[i]. You want to erase some elements to make the sequence good, but you can only remove elements with W[i] ≤ k. Find the minimum possible k to make the sequence good.

# Solution Sketch

Binary search on k. Fix k, and each element is either erasable or unerasable; now forget about W.

Let DP[i] = true iff you can make the sequence [i..N] good, with DP[N+1] always true. For each i, you have two options:

* erase it (if you can), which gives DP[i+1].
* don't erase it. The set of possible indices of the next subsegment can be expressed as an interval [l, r], which can be computed in O(1) by storing the unerasable indices. This gives DP[l] | DP[l+1] | ... | DP[r].

Now optimize the second option by std::set, or Fenwick, or just two pointers (since both l and r are decreasing). The whole problem is then solved in O(NlogN) or O(Nlog^2N).
