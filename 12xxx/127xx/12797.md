# Problem

You are given M ≤ 1,000 numbers. For each combination with replacement with size N ≤ 10^9, consider the product of the numbers in the combination. Find the sum of the products modulo 10^9+7.

# Solution Sketch

Using the generating function, the problem reduces to computing the coefficient of x^n in (1+A[1]x+A[1]^2x^2+...) ... (1+A[m]x+A[m]^2x^2+...).

This equals 1/[(1-A[1]x)...(1-A[m]x)].

This can be decomposed into the sum of C[i]/(1-A[i]x). To find C[i], multiply each side by (1-A[i]x), then let x = 1/A[i]. You'll need O(logN) exponentiation and modular inverse.

This then equals the sum of C[i](1+A[i]x+A[i]^2x^2+...). Therefore, the answer is the sum of C[i]A[i]^n.
