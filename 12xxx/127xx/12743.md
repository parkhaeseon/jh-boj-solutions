# Problem

You want to produce two substances: A and B.

* 1 gram of A requires GA[i] grams of material M[i], for each i.
* 1 gram of B requires GB[i] grams of material M[i], for each i.
* You have W[i] grams of M[i], for each i.

1 gram of A and B is worth X and Y, respectively. Find the amount of A and B you can produce such that the total worth is maximized. N ¡Â 1,000,000.

# Solution Sketch

First, read the solution to the smaller version: [12742](12xxx/127xx/12742.md)

Instead of (GA[i])a + (GB[i])b ¡Â W[i], think about b ¡Â -(GA[i]/GB[i])a + W[i]/GB[i]. The i-th inequality can be turned into an equality iff -(GA[i]/GB[i])a + W[i]/GB[i] attains minimum for at least one value of a from 0 to W[i]/GA[i]. (The "from 0 to W[i]/GA[i]" constraint is necessary to ensure that a and b are nonnegative.)

Therefore, we need to look at the lines that can possibly be a minimum. This can be done with the convex hull trick data structure. Sort the lines by -(GA[i]/GB[i]), then add the lines one by one into the convex hull trick.
