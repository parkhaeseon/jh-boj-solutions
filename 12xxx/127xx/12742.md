# Problem

You want to produce two substances: A and B.

* 1 gram of A requires GA[i] grams of material M[i], for each i.
* 1 gram of B requires GB[i] grams of material M[i], for each i.
* You have W[i] grams of M[i], for each i.

1 gram of A and B is worth X and Y, respectively. Find the amount of A and B you can produce such that the total worth is maximized. N ¡Â 200.

# Solution Sketch

This is basically a linear programming problem on two variables: we want to maximize Xa + Yb s.t (GA[i])a + (GB[i])b ¡Â W[i] for each i. But let's not think about using Simplex, okay?

In an optimal solution, at least one inequality must be an equality. That is, (GA[i])a + (GB[i])b = W[i] for at least one i. Fix one such i, then find the range of a such that all the inequalities are satisfied, a ¡Ã 0, and b ¡Ã 0. This is the intersection of intervals, so in the end you will get either an empty set, or something like [l, r]. In the case of [l, r], the optimal solution will occur at either a = l or a = r. Total time complexity is O(N^2).

# Commentaries

Can you solve it in O(NlogN)? Refer to [12743](12xxx/127xx/12743.md) for the solution.
