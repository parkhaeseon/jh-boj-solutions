# Problem

You are given a permutation of odd length N ≤ 99,999. You sort a subsegment M ≤ 100,000 times, increasing or decreasing. Find the ((N+1)/2)-th element.

# Solution Sketch

Binary search on the answer. To determine if answer ≤ x, change all numbers ≤ x to 0, others to 1, and check if ((N+1)/2)-th is 0 after all the flips. This is just a segment tree with lazy propagation; sorting can be done in one query and two updates.
