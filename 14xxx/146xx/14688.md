# Problem

You have a graph with N ≤ 100,000 vertices and M ≤ 200,000 edges with weights. N-1 edges are "activated", and form a spanning tree as well.

You are given D. You can pick one edge, and change its weight to max(0, C-D), where C is the original weight. You want to minimize the total weight of the activated edges. You can activate X edges and deactivate X edges, and the activated edges must form a spanning tree again. What is the smallest possible X?

# Solution Sketch

If D = 0, you can solve the problem by replacing each C with 100000C + x, where x is 0 if the edge is activated and 1 if deactivated.

Now suppose you picked some edge e and changed its weight to max(0, C-D). Then it's a waste to NOT choose e for the final spanning tree, because if e is not in the tree, you could have chosen something else and reduce its weight. Therefore, we should find an MST that contains e. That is exactly the same problem as [15481](/15xxx/154xx/15481.md) (but the solution for 15481 might not be ready in my GitHub repository. If you need help, please make an issue.)
