# Problem

There are N ≤ 200,000 people on the internet. i-th person befriends you if either

* you have already befriended A[i] other people, or
* you gave B[i] internet points to that person. (Let's call it "forcing the i-th person")

Befriend all people while giving as few internet points as possible.

# Solution Sketch

By sorting, assume A[0] ≤ ... ≤ A[N-1]. (You need a tiebreaker, but let's think about it later.) If you don't give any internet points, then you can befriend everyone iff, for all i, A[i] ≤ i.

Now let D[i] = A[i] - i. The above is equivalent to D[i] ≤ 0.

Forcing i is the same as making A[i] = 0 and moving i to before 0. But instead of moving, let's just decrement D[0], ..., D[i-1] by 1 and D[i] by infinity.

Now, let i be the largest index such that D[i] > 0. Then you must force either i, i+1, ..., or N-1. Also, it can be easily shown that D[i] = 1, so "decrement D[i] by infinity" is not necessary; just decrement it by 1. So who must you force? The one with the smallest B[j], of course. Also, for that reason, a tiebreaker for sorting should be in the decreasing order of B.

You just need to keep doing this until all D[i] becomes ≤ 0. Be sure not to force the same person more than once. An implementation with a priority queue gives O(NlogN).
