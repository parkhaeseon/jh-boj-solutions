# Problem

The turn-based 2-player game starts with two positive integers A ≤ 10,000 and B ≤ 30. Another integer 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^9 is also given. At each turn, the player increments either A or B by 1. If A^B ≥ N, that player loses. Does anyone have a winning strategy? Who?

# Solution Sketch

It's just a usual game DP... or is it? The thing is, there are too many states when A = 1 or B = 1, so we need to take care of those special cases.

If A = 1 and B ≥ 30, then both players will keep incrementing B, because they can't increment A. So it's a draw.

If B = 1 and A ≥ 31623, then both players will keep incrementing A, because they can't increment B. So the winner can be decided in O(1).
