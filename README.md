This is an archive of problems I have solved in [Baekjoon Online Judge](https://www.acmicpc.net/). For each problem I solved, I will write the summary of the problem, solution sketch, and some additional commentaries if I have any.

Why did I make this?

* Some of the problems are worth introducing, but is only available in Korean. Some problems are missing their written solutions. I wanted to kill two birds with one stone by creating this archive.
* I wanted to document my problem solving career. I've been personally writing very short summaries for each problem, but sometimes one sentence is not enough to explain the problem or the solution. I expect that by browsing through this repository I would remind myself of the solution much easier.
* TODO
