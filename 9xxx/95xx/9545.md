# Problem

You are given N ≤ 676 pairs of lowercase alphabets, which are the "digraphs". Find the largest square grid of lowercase alphabets such that no row or column contains any digraph. If the largest grid is infinite or has size ≥ 20x20, just output the 20x20 grid instead.

# Solution Sketch

Build a directed graph (digraph?!) of allowed pairs of alphabets. Take the longest walk. Then the largest grid has size (L+1)/2 where L is the length of the walk. L is infinite iff the graph has a cycle; otherwise L can be computed with recursive DP.

If your walk is, say, abcde, then your grid will be:

```
abc
bcd
cde
```
