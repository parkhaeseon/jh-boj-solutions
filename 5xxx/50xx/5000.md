# Problem

You are given two permutations A and B, both of length N ≤ 100,000. The only allowed operation is to choose a subarray of length 3 in A and rotate it, e.g. [2,3,4] becomes [4,2,3]. Determine whether you can change A into B.

# Solution Sketch

Rotating the indices i, i+1, and i+2 is the same as applying the permutation (i i+1 i+2). Since (i i+1 i+2) is an even permutation, the parity of A will be preserved. If the parity of A and B are different, then the answer is no. This can be checked by decomposing the permutation into cycles and counting the even cycles.

Otherwise, yes. Proof is done by induction. First, by substituting the numbers, we may assume B = [1, 2, ..., N]. For N = 3, you can check it by yourself. For N > 3, send N to the last index and apply induction.
