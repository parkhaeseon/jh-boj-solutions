# Problem

Find the number of N-digit numbers in base B such that

* all adjacent digits differ by exactly 1, and
* all digits appear at least once,

modulo 10^9. Both N and B are at most 2,000.

# Solution Sketch

DP, where each DP state is represented by (n, a, b, d) where

* n is the number of digits so far,
* a is 1 if 0 appears at least once, otherwise 0,
* b is 1 if B-1 appears at least once, otherwise 1,
* d is the last digit.

The answer is the sum of DP(N, 1, 1, d) over all d.

# Commentaries

For some reason most problem solvers in Korea seem to think that [1562](/1xxx/15xx/1562.md) is a bitmask DP O(N2^B) problem, but I think it's much easier to come up with an O(NB^2) solution. So I posted that on my blog, and sait2000 pointed out that it can be optimized to O(NB). Some months later, I converted that solution to this problem.

Can you solve it even faster?! Someone made the same problem with larger inputs, but I can't solve it :(
